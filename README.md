Hi Anna!
I`m riding at business trip now and  got your proposal just recently. 
So, i made first path of test task :
Steps:
1. Find any open source web application that you like, written in Go, Python or PHP.
2. Implement a `Dockerfile` to dockerize this application (or use existing one).
3. Implement a `docker-compose.yaml` spec to run this application in dockerized environment.

Requirements:
- Everything is dockerized.
- Getting whole application up with single `docker-compose up`.

And next task shall prepare tomorrow. Is it acceptable?

Feel free to check my
